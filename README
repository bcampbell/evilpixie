EvilPixie

Overview
--------

A pixel-oriented paint program. If you ever used Deluxe Paint, this should
be familiar :-)

Currently only supports paletted images.


Building from source (some random notes)
----------------------------------------

depends upon:
qt4
libxpm
libdevil
libgif
(more?)


All QT code is kept inside src/qt. All the core stuff (in src/) is pretty
abstracted and could be used on any GUI system (eg I was thinking of doing
a Nintendo DS homebrew version some time)

To build:

$ qmake evilpixie.pro
$ make
