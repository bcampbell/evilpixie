DevIL issues
------------

DOC: ilSetPixels description refers to ilCopyPixels by mistake.

ilTexImage creates IL_ORIGIN_LOWER_LEFT images. No way to change this from
public API.

No gif saving.

No way to get supported load/save formats at runtime.
No way to figure out which formats support animation
No way to figure out which formats support indexed images

Colour key setting is per format (one for png, another for gif)

ilRegisterPal name is misleading (not really part of register fns).
Should be ilSetPal() or something.

ilRegister* fns are supposed to be for use by file format extensions...

IFF loading: unify frontend for ILBM and CIMG because they share .iff
filename extension
